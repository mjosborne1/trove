Trove is a playful spin on a comment made by a colleague who said he was told that I have the most recent trove of exercises or related materials that could be reused/referenced for a Connectathon. Glossary ECL (Expression Constraint Language) is a formal, declarative language for defining precise, computable subsets of clinical meanings within SNOMED CT, allowing rich querying and constraint definition for tasks like restricting EHR data, building value sets (e.g., for FHIR), and defining reference sets by specifying relationships and attributes between concepts. ECL expressions are executable rules that define intensional sets, enabling powerful data analysis and interoperability by precisely identifying groups of related clinical concepts. Intensional value set defines a group of SNOMED CT concepts using a logical rule or algorithm, rather than listing every single code, allowing it to dynamically update as new codes are added. For example, it could be defined as \"all descendants of the 'Diabetes' concept\". Extensional value set a predefined, explicit list of specific concepts in a value set. The value set can only contain those enumerated values in the expansion. The value set expansion cannot change without redefining the logical definition of the valueset. For example a 'Gender Identity ValueSet' might contain explicitly stated concepts for 'Female gender identity', 'Male gender identity' and 'Non-binary gender identity'.

I've been working with health terminology since the early 2000's when I moved from Medical Laboratory Scientist to lab system development and configuration. Professional Background Since 2023, I've been employed at CSIRO AEHRC to work on terminology artifacts in FHIR Implementation Guides for the Sparked FHIR Accelerator project. Expertise My main expertise is with Pathology and Radiology systems, HL7 V2 and FHIR. I've been on the SNOMED International Content Committee and Modeling Advisory Group. I've contributed to LOINC and have been a LOINC mapper and user since 2001. I also frequent the FHIR chat forum, Zulip . Interests I'm passionate about using terminology servers to improve terminology usability. Terminology servers give you a single approach to managing and utilising SNOMED CT and other code systems.
