# About Me

I am Michael Osborne, a self-confessed terminology nerd. I've been working with health terminology since the early 2000's when I moved from Medical Laboratory Scientist to lab system development and configuration.

## Professional Background

Since 2023, I've been employed at CSIRO AEHRC to work on terminology artifacts in FHIR Implementation Guides for the Sparked FHIR Accelerator project.

## Expertise

My main expertise is with Pathology and Radiology systems, HL7 V2 and FHIR. I've been on the SNOMED International Content Committee and Modeling Advisory Group. I've contributed to LOINC and have been a LOINC mapper and user since 2001. I also frequent the FHIR chat forum, [Zulip](https://chat.fhir.org/). 

## Interests

I'm passionate about using terminology servers to improve terminology usability. Terminology servers give you a single approach to managing and utilising SNOMED CT and other code systems.
