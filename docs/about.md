# About Me

I am Michael Osborne, a self-confessed terminology nerd. I've been working with health terminology since the early 2000's when I moved from Medical Laboratory Scientist to lab system development and configuration.

## Professional Background

I'm currently employed at CSIRO and working on terminology for FHIR Implementation Guides.

## Expertise

My main expertise is with Pathology and Radiology systems, HL7 V2 and FHIR. I've been on the SNOMED International Content Committee and Modeling Advisory Group. I frequently contribute to LOINC forums and have been a LOINC mapper and user since 2001.

## Interests

I'm passionate about using terminology servers to improve terminology usability. Terminology servers give you a single approach to managing and utilising SNOMED CT and other code systems.
